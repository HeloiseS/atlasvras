Eyeballer Cheat Sheet
===================
As an eyeballer the main bot you will encounter is `st3ph3n`, the eyeballer VRA.
It will trigger as soon as an ATLAS ingest is complete and send a message to the `#vra` channel on the
QUB slack.
It will tell you:

* 1) How many Fast Track (<100 Mpc) objects have rank >4 and how many other (low rank) alerts there are.You should **eyeball ALL ranks in the Fast Track list**.

* 2) How many alerts in the standard eyeball list with ranks >4.
