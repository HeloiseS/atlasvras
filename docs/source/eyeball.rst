Eyeballer Cheat Sheet
===================
.. _Eyeballing handbook: https://www.overleaf.com/project/653678f3e33892fbb51fe7b8

.. seealso::
   The `rota <Rota_>`_ is at the bottom of this page.


.. note::
   You should already be familiar with eyeballing either because you read Michael's `Eyeballing handbook`_ or because you were trained by one of the experienced eyeballers.



First Eyeballer
~~~~~~~~~~~~
    - **Eyeball ASAP** when messages come through. GOTO, Alerce and other programs see the sky too ;)
    - **Fast Track list**: eyeball all ranks
    - **Standard list**: eyeball ranks >4
    - If you're not sure: **snooze** by putting in **Possible list**.

Second Eyeballer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   - Check the **good** list for anything interesting to put in **follow-up**

Xmas Eyeballing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   - You can check the Xmas `rota <Rota_>`_ and add your day to your calendar.
   - When it is your day **you are both eyeballer 1 and eyeballer 2**
   - At the end of your shift **get in touch with the next eyeballer** to make sure
     they know they are taking over.

st3ph3n-bot
-----------------
As an eyeballer, the main bot you will encounter is your virtual
counterpart: ``st3ph3n``. **Make sure you are in the #vra channel
and receiving alerts**. Its role is to **rank the alerts from 0 to 10**,
with higher ranks being more likely to be extra-galactic transients.
It also automatically garbages alerts with low scores (for more detail see
`Garbage Policies <about.html#garbaging>`_) so you can focus on the most
promising alerts.

The slackbot triggers at the end of each ATLAS ingest and sends a
message the ``#vra`` channel on the QUB slack. In each `st3ph3n`
alert you will see two lines:

1. How many Fast Track (<100 Mpc) objects have rank >4 and how many other (low rank) alerts there are.You should **eyeball ALL ranks in the Fast Track list**.
2. How many alerts in the standard eyeball list with ranks >4.

.. warning::
   The number of alerts to be eyeballed is **usually over estimated**. It's a bug we have to fix.

Tips for eyeballer 1
----------------------

1. **Start with the Fast Track list**. Also note that you need to eyeball **all** ranks (even the lower ones) in the Fast Track list.
2. Go back to slack and **click on the eyeball link** provided by ``st3ph3n``. This will take you to the curated eyeball list (ordered and cropped down to rank 4).
3. Scroll down to the first alerts that or **not** rank 10 and eyeball these. They are the most promising which haven't yet been pinched by another team.
4. Finally clean up the rank 10 alerts.


.. warning::
   A rank of **10** means that the alert has been **cross-matched to TNS**. It does **not necessarily mean it is real**.
