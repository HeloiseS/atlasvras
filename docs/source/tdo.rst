ATLAS TDO Notes
==========================

The new unit of ATLAS (in Teide) started being ingested on 2025-06-23 (MJD 60,849).
Currently things are running without bespoke wallpapers, CNNs or VRA retraining. 
In these notes I roughly assess the effect of the addition of TDO to our data-stream and 
the VRA retraining strategy in the short term.
