This repository contains data processing and models that are used by the ATLAS Virtual Research Assistants
in the production pipeline. 
For code specific to the downloading, cleaning of the training data, and training of the models, go to [TBD]

## st3ph3n
st3ph3n is the eyeballing VRA.
**DESCRIBE VRA and current eyeballing policies**

## el01z
el01z is a monitoring bot that checks what has been done by other VRAs 
and sends regular (weekly) slack messages to the QUB workspace to keep everyone up to date.

## TBD
[TBD] is the VRA monitoring the active extragalactic transients in ATLAS.
It will:
* check for fast risers [short term]
* check for slow risers [short term]
* provide preliminary classifications based on LC alone [medium term]
* provide some forecasting to alert of any interesting objects that may be getting faint [medium term]
* do som anomaly detection [long term]
